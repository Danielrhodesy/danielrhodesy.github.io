## Production

This application was created in a week with 6 people. Our strengths and weaknesses really showed in this timeframe as we had little time to create a full stack application. With our group sticking to an agile process with daily stand ups and check ins with our product manager we kep to track as much as we could. If we had internal issues we would divide time to resolve them. We use React, Redux mySQL to create databases for our local APIS so we could manipulate data for the user to see when they toggled it. We used leaflet for our maps and had to learn this libraries documentation to fully use it for the project.The application also has more functions as a functional bill splitter to help users split payments during their trip. Also an itinerary to help the user organise their trip. Each one of these functions went on a process of constant redesigning as we had small UX process with getting outside information and trials with our current start functions and made improvements.
