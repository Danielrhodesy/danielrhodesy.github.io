## UX Process

During these weeks I created open-ended surveys to the target audience. I did interviews with potential users of the application, created wireframes to help get direction with design and the UI of the application. Groups tested were done with the Low-Fi and High-Fi wireframes to groups of people in the target audience. Through multiple iterations and refining of this process, I finalized my project for production.

## Production

This project used wordpress and PHP to create this template. The application had to be responsive over all devices for the clarity of the users to my product owner. The application would let the user create multiple pages and also edit any kind of contacts with making tabs and changing colours to pages of the site.
