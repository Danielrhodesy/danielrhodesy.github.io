## UX Process

</figure>

This application was done in the 3rd term of my Yoobee course. After 3 weeks of doing and repeating the UX process so we could get our final pitch for each of our projects we then had groups of 3 people per project. 




## Production

We ran in an Agile matter as we had daily stand ups and check ins with other team members. Also with keeping a good connection with our product Owner. The application was in React and we had to learn how to adapt our already learn APIs into react setting. This may have caused some hardship but by the end our team was happy with the result.

Please inspect or view in Mobile. Due to our time limit we had to restrict and cut some of our backlog.
