Hi im Dan! 

I have been web developing on a contract basis for the last two years. This has provided me with opportunities to improve on skills and gain the necessary experience in problem solving with both front end and back end applications.  This has also allowed me to improve interacting with clients and the teams including receiving feedback with respect to self/peer reviewing.

In addition to the above I have always ensured that I keep up to date with new tech by additional study and research.
