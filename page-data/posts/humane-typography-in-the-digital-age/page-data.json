With our group sticking to an agile process with daily stand-ups and check-ins with our product manager we kept to a strict plan through the week so we could make deadlines. Using react as the framework for our project was necessary for time frames and the limits we wanted to push the front end along with redux. RESTFUL APIs were created so we could interact with the MySQL databases. Creating Pulls and Posts so that users could add or remove points and locations on the map. Filtering the maps pinpoints was also created as a bottom toolbar.  We used leaflet for our maps and had to learn this libraryâ€™s documentation to fully use it for the project. The application also has more javascript functions as a functional bill splitter to help users split payments during their trip. Also, an itinerary to help the user organize their trip. Each one of these functions went on a process of constant redesigning as we had multiple UX cycles with getting outside information and testing so these functions would be used properly.</p>\n<p><a><a href=\"http://kiwiroadtrip.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://kiwiroadtrip.herokuapp.com/</a></a></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 960px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/eec88/krt.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 47.08333333333333%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/8ac56/krt.webp 240w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/d3be9/krt.webp 480w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/e46b2/krt.webp 960w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/f992d/krt.webp 1440w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/882b9/krt.webp 1920w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/d3d72/krt.webp 2880w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/09b79/krt.jpg 240w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/7cc5e/krt.jpg 480w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/6a068/krt.jpg 960w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/644c5/krt.jpg 1440w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/0f98f/krt.jpg 1920w,\n/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/eec88/krt.jpg 2880w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/portfolio-deploy/static/081c23e303770082bbcf9019c7be2972/6a068/krt.jpg\"\n          alt=\"krt.jpg\"\n          title=\"krt.jpg\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/humane-typography-in-the-digital-age/","tagSlugs":["/tag/react/","/tag/my-sql/","/tag/redux/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-08-19T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Kiwi Road Tripper is an application to help tourists and local people of New Zealand to be more creative with their route through the country.
