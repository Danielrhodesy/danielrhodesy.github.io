After 3 weeks of doing the UX process so we could get our final pitch for each of our projects we then had groups of 3 people per project.</p>\n<p>My UX process went through multiple iterations. Starting with general research with surveys to try and find my target audience. Then with creating some wireframes and Low-Fi’s to be tested on by testing groups. After refining my design and UI elements I took the results to production.</p>\n<h2 id=\"production\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#production\" aria-label=\"production permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Production</h2>\n<p>We ran in an Agile matter as we had daily stand-ups and check-ins with other team members. Also with keeping a good connection with our Product Owner. The application’s front end framework was React. Using React was essential for the time constraints this project had. We could create all our content pages easily and with elements crossing multiple pages and data being shown through the app. </p>\n<p>Please inspect or view it in Mobile. Due to our time limit, we had to restrict and cut some of our backlog.</p>\n<p><a><a href=\"https://mhf-app.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://mhf-app.herokuapp.com/</a></a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/a-brief-history-of-typography/","tagSlugs":["/tag/react/","/tag/ux-process/","/tag/google-ap-is/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-07-02T22:40:32.169Z","description":"MHF is an application to help show people statistics of mental health problems in New Zealand.
